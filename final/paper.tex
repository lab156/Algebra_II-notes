Let $\theta \from \hom_S(B,C)\otimes_R B \to C$ defined as:
$$\theta (h\otimes_R b)= h(b)$$
Where $h\in \hom_S(B,C)$ and $b\in B$. Observe that the tensor product  $\hom_S(B,C) \otimes_R B$ makes sense because:
$$b \otimes_R(rb) = (h\, r) \otimes_ R b$$
And $h\,r$ is well-defined whenever it is for the argument of this morphism by setting it to be $h\, r =h \circ \pi_r$. And $\pi_r$ is the premultiplication morphism $\pi_r(b)=r\, b$.

Likewise, $\theta$ is a well-defined right $S-$module and group morphism, to wit:
$$\theta((h \otimes_ R b)s)=\theta(h \otimes_ R (b\, s))=h(b\, s)= h(b)s$$
And for an also arbitrary $b'\in B$:
$$\theta(h \otimes_ R (b+b'))=\theta(h \otimes_ R b+ h \otimes_ R b')=h(b+b')=h(b)+h(b')$$
Idem for the case of $(h+h')  \otimes_ R b$.

On the other hand, now take $\lambda \from A \to \hom_S(B,A\otimes_R B)$\footnote{The ``misprint''  is that $R$ appears here as the base ring, but $S$ is the best choice in this case.} defined as: $\lambda (a) = h_a\in \hom_S(B,A\otimes_R B)$ defined for all $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ as: 
$$h_a(b) = a \otimes_R b $$
Notice that $\lambda$ is a well-defined right $R-$module homomorphism since $\lambda(a\,r) = h_{ra}$ and:
$$h_{a\,r}(b) = (a\, r) \otimes_ R b = a \otimes_ R (r\,b)= h_a(r\, b) = h_ar(b)$$
Since this is the case for any $b\in B$ then $\lambda(ar)= h_a r= \lambda(a)r$. To show that $\lambda$ is a group morphism requires of  an identical proof.

$K=\ZZ_2(x)$ is a field in which the element $x$ is prime. This is because 

\problem{6}
Let $\phi \from A\to B$ be a monomorphism. The induced morphims of $\phi$ is defined for all $f\in \hom(B,\QQ/\ZZ)$ as: 
$$\theta f= id\circ f\circ \phi$$
In specific if we look at $A,B$ as $\ZZ-$modules,  $\phi$ becomes a $\ZZ-$module homomorphism that is injective thus the following sequence is split exact:
$$0\to A \xrightarrow \phi B \to B \to 0$$
By Proposition IV.4.4 this is equivalent to:
$$0\to \hom(B,\QQ/\ZZ) \to \hom(B,\QQ/\ZZ) \xrightarrow \theta \hom(A,\QQ/\ZZ) \to 0$$
Being an exact sequence of Abelian groups.
