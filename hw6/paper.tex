\problem{V.3.9}
Assuming that $F$ is the algebraic closure of $K$, let $E$ be any algebraic field extension.
Let us call $\bar E$ the algebraic closure of $E$, which we know to exist by Theorem V.3.6.
Also by  Theorem V.3.6, we know that $\bar E \cong F$, and say $\sigma$ is the $K-$isomorphism between these two fields.
