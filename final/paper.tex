Let $\phi \from A\to B$ be a monomorphism. The induced morphims of $\phi$ is defined for all $f\in \hom(B,\QQ/\ZZ)$ as: 
$$\theta f= id\circ f\circ \phi$$
In specific if we look at $A,B$ as $\ZZ-$modules,  $\phi$ becomes a $\ZZ-$module homomorphism that is injective thus the following sequence is split exact:
$$0\to A \xrightarrow \phi B \to B \to 0$$
By Proposition IV.4.4 this is equivalent to:
$$0\to \hom(B,\QQ/\ZZ) \to \hom(B,\QQ/\ZZ) \xrightarrow \theta \hom(A,\QQ/\ZZ) \to 0$$
Being an exact sequence of Abelian groups.
