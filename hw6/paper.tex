\problem{V.3.9}
Assuming that $F$ is the algebraic closure of $K$, let $E$ be any algebraic field extension.
Let us call $\bar E$ the algebraic closure of $E$, which we know to exist by Theorem V.3.6.
Also by  Theorem V.3.6, we know that $\bar E \cong F$, and say $\sigma$ is the $K-$isomorphism between these two fields.
Therefore the restriction $\sigma|_E$ is $K-$monomorphism that we want

Conversely, let $f\in K[x]$. We will show that $f$ has a root in $F$.
Let $E$ be an extension over $F$ such that $f$ splits in $E$; and $u\in E$ a root of $f$.
We are assuming that there exists a $K-$monomorphism $\sigma\from E\to F$.
Therefore $\sigma(f(u))=f(\sigma(u))=0$, and $\sigma(u)\in F$ is a root of $f$. 

\problem{V.3.11}
\subsection*{both part (a) and (b)}
Let $u\in F$ and $f\in K[x]$ be its minimal polynomial and $T\subset K[x]$ the set of all these polynomials.
Next, take $\bar K$ to be a splitting field of $T$ over $K$. 
Notice that since each $f\in T$ is separable there is a splitting field of $f$ in which all roots are simple, call it $K_f$. 
Then $K_f$ is generated by the roots of $f$.
$\bar K$ splits this same polynomial, then there exists an isomorphism between $K_f$ and a subfield of $\bar K$.
Implying the elementary but undispensable result that $f$ is separable in all field extensions of $K$.

The condition of $F$ being finitely generated is not important here because there is always a splitting field extension that contains all algebraic elements i.e. the algebraic closure.
$\bar K$ is also an extension of $F$, since $F$ is algebraic (it is generated by separable elements which we assume to be algebraic).

Now we can assert that $\bar K$ is a splitting field of a set of separable polynomials $T$.
Thus by theorem V.3.11 ((iii)$\implies $(ii)) $\bar K$ is separable and $F$ is just a subset of it.
