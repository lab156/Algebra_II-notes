\problem{V.3.9}
Assuming that $F$ is the algebraic closure of $K$, let $E$ be any algebraic field extension.
Let us call $\bar E$ the algebraic closure of $E$, which we know to exist by Theorem V.3.6.
Also by  Theorem V.3.6, we know that $\bar E \cong F$, and say $\sigma$ is the $K-$isomorphism between these two fields.
Therefore the restriction $\sigma|_E$ is $K-$monomorphism that we want

Conversely, let $f\in K[x]$. We will show that $f$ has a root in $F$.
Let $E$ be an extension over $F$ such that $f$ splits in $E$; and $u\in E$ a root of $f$.
We are assuming that there exists a $K-$monomorphism $\sigma\from E\to F$.
Therefore $\sigma(f(u))=f(\sigma(u))=0$, and $\sigma(u)\in F$ is a root of $f$.
